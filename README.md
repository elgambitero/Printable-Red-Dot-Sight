# Printable-Red-Dot-Sight
Red Dot Sight for airsoft sport guns.

The intention is to make a holographic red dot aiming sight for airsoft rifles.
For now, the mounting will be based on the picatinny rail, but later versions
may support any other tipe of mounting.

The sight will work with next to no circuitry, being a red led and a 3V button
cell the only components.
